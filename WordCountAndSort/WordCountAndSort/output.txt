Etymology
Aristotle
C
BC
one
of
the
early
figures
in
the
development
of
the
scientific
method
The
word
research
is
derived
from
the
Middle
French
recherche
which
means
to
go
about
seeking
the
term
itself
being
derived
from
the
Old
French
term
recerchier
a
compound
word
from
re
cerchier
or
sercher
meaning
search
The
earliest
recorded
use
of
the
term
was
in
Definitions
Research
has
been
defined
in
a
number
of
different
ways
and
while
there
are
similarities
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
single
all
encompassing
definition
that
is
embraced
by
all
who
engage
in
it
One
definition
of
research
is
used
by
the
OECD
Any
creative
systematic
activity
undertaken
in
order
to
increase
the
stock
of
knowledge
including
knowledge
of
man
culture
and
society
and
the
use
of
this
knowledge
to
devise
new
applications
Another
definition
of
research
is
given
by
John
W
Creswell
who
states
that
r
esearch
is
a
process
of
steps
used
to
collect
and
analyze
information
to
increase
our
understanding
of
a
topic
or
issue
It
consists
of
three
steps
pose
a
question
collect
data
to
answer
the
question
and
present
an
answer
to
the
question
The
Merriam
Webster
Online
Dictionary
defines
research
in
more
detail
as
studious
inquiry
or
examination
especially
investigation
or
experimentation
aimed
at
the
discovery
and
interpretation
of
facts
revision
of
accepted
theories
or
laws
in
the
light
of
new
facts
or
practical
application
of
such
new
or

Original
research
is
research
that
is
not
exclusively
based
on
a
summary
review
or
synthesis
of
earlier
publications
on
the
subject
of
research
This
material
is
of
a
primary
source
character
The
purpose
of
the
original
research
is
to
produce
new
knowledge
rather
than
to
present
the
existing
knowledge
in
a
new
form
e
g
summarized
or
classified
Original
research
can
take
a
number
of
forms
depending
on
the
discipline
it
pertains
to
In
experimental
work
it
typically
involves
direct
or
indirect
observation
of
the
researched
subject
s
e
g
in
the
laboratory
or
in
the
field
documents
the
methodology
results
and
conclusions
of
an
experiment
or
set
of
experiments
or
offers
a
novel
interpretation
of
previous
results
In
analytical
work
there
are
typically
some
new
for
example
mathematical
results
produced
or
a
new
way
of
approaching
an
existing
problem
In
some
subjects
which
do
not
typically
carry
out
experimentation
or
analysis
of
this
kind
the
originality
is
in
the
particular
way
existing
understanding
is
changed
or
re
interpreted
based
on
the
outcome
of
the
work
of
the
researcher
The
degree
of
originality
of
the
research
is
among
major
criteria
for
articles
to
be
published
in
academic
journals
and
usually
established
by
means
of
peer
review
Graduate
students
are
commonly
required
to
perform
original
research
as
part
of
a
dissertation
Scientific
research
is
a
systematic
way
of
gathering
data
and
harnessing
curiosity
This
research
provides
scientific
information
and
theories
for
the
explanation
of
the
nature
and
the
properties
of
the
world
It
makes
practical
applications
possible
Scientific
research
is
funded
by
public
authorities
by
charitable
organizations
and
by
private
groups
including
many
companies
Scientific
research
can
be
subdivided
into
different
classifications
according
to
their
academic
and
application
disciplines
Scientific
research
is
a
widely
used
criterion
for
judging
the
standing
of
an
academic
institution
but
some
argue
that
such
is
an
inaccurate
assessment
of
the
institution
because
the
quality
of
research
does
not
tell
about
the
quality
of
teaching
these
do
not
necessarily
correlate
Research
in
the
humanities
involves
different
methods
such
as
for
example
hermeneutics
and
semiotics
Humanities
scholars
usually
do
not
search
for
the
ultimate
correct
answer
to
a
question
but
instead
explore
the
issues
and
details
that
surround
it
Context
is
always
important
and
context
can
be
social
historical
political
cultural
or
ethnic
An
example
of
research
in
the
humanities
is
historical
research
which
is
embodied
in
historical
method
Historians
use
primary
sources
and
other
evidence
to
systematically
investigate
a
topic
and
then
to
write
histories
in
the
form
of
accounts
of
the
past
Other
studies
aim
to
merely
examine
the
occurrence
of
behaviours
in
societies
and
communities
without
particularly
looking
for
reasons
or
motivations
to
explain
these
These
studies
may
be
qualitative
or
quantitative
and
can
use
a
variety
of
approaches
such
as
queer
theory
or
feminist
theory
Artistic
research
also
seen
as
practice
based
research
can
take
form
when
creative
works
are
considered
both
the
research
and
the
object
of
research
itself
It
is
the
debatable
body
of
thought
which
offers
an
alternative
to
purely
scientific
methods

its
search

Generally
research
is
understood
to
follow
a
certain
structural
process
Though
step

may
vary

research

area
of

s
interest
and
following
that
subject
area
to
conduct

research
The
subject
area
should
not
be
randomly
chosen
since
it
requires
reading
a
vast
amount
of
literature
on
the
topic
to
determine
the
gap
in
the
literature
the
researcher
intends
to
narrow
A
keen
interest
in
the
chosen
subject
area
is
advisable
The
research
will
have
to
be
justified
by
linking
its
importance
to
already
existing

reiteration
if
necessary
A
common
misconception
is
that
a
hypothesis
will
be
proven
see
rather
null
hypothesis
Generally
a
hypothesis
is
used
to
make
predictions
that
can
be
tested
by
observing
the
outcome
of
an
experiment
If
the
outcome
is
inconsistent
with
the
hypothesis
then
the
hypothesis
is
rejected
see
falsifiability
However
if
the
outcome
is
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
the
experiment
is
said
to
support
the
hypothesis
This
careful
language
is
used
because
researchers
recognize
that
alternative
hypotheses
may
also
be
consistent
with
the
observations
In
this
sense
a
hypothesis
can
never
be
proven
but
rather
only
supported
by
surviving
rounds
of
scientific
testing
and
eventually
becoming
widely
thought
of
as
true
A
useful
hypothesis
allows
prediction
and
within
the
accuracy
of
observation
of
the
time
the
prediction
will
be
verified
As
the
accuracy
of
observation
improves
with
time
the
hypothesis
may
no
longer
provide
an
accurate
prediction
In
this
case
a
new
hypothesis
will
arise
to
challenge
the
old
and
to
the
extent
that
the
new
hypothesis
makes
more
accurate
predictions
than
the
old
the
new
will
supplant
it
Researchers
can
also
use
a
null
hypothesis
which
states
no
relationship
or
difference
between
the
independent
or
dependent
variables

German
historian
Leopold

considered
to
be
one
of
the
founders
of

history
The
historical
method
comprises
the
techniques
and
guidelines
by
which
historians
use
historical
sources
and
other
evidence
to
research
and
then
to
write
history
There

history
guidelines
that
are
commonly
used
by
historians
in
their
work
under
the
headings
of
external

Artistic
research
The
controversial
trend
of
artistic
teaching
becoming
more
academics
oriented
is
leading
to
artistic
research
being
accepted
as
the
primary
mode
of
enquiry
in
art
as
in
the
case
of
other
disciplines
One
of
the
characteristics
of
artistic
research
is
that
it
must
accept
subjectivity
as
opposed
to
the
classical
scientific
methods
As
such
it
is
similar
to
the
social
sciences
in
using
qualitative
research
and
intersubjectivity
as
tools
to
apply
measurement
and
critical
analysis
Artistic
research
has
been
defined
by
the
University

Dance
and

in
the
following
manner
Artistic
research
is
to

and

with
the

It

Steps
in
conducting
research
Research
is
often
conducted
using
the
hourglass
model
structure
of
research
The
hourglass
model
starts
with
a
broad
spectrum
for
research
focusing
in
on
the
required
information
through
the
method
of
the
project
like
the
neck
of
the
hourglass
then
expands
the
research
in
the
form
of
discussion
and
results
The
major
steps
in
conducting
research
are
Identification
of
research
problem
Literature
review
Specifying
the
purpose
of
research
Determining
specific
research
questions
Specification
of
a
conceptual
framework
sometimes
including
a
set
of
hypotheses
Choice
of
a
methodology
for
data
collection
Data
collection
Verifying
data
Analyzing
and
interpreting
the
data
Reporting
and
evaluating
research
Communicating
the
research
findings
and
possibly
recommendations
The
steps
generally
represent
the
overall
process
however
they
should
be
viewed
as
an
ever
changing
iterative
process
rather
than
a
fixed
set
of
steps
Most
research
begins
with
a
general
statement
of
the
problem
or
rather
the
purpose
for
engaging
in
the
study
The
literature
review
identifies
flaws
or
holes
in
previous
research
which
provides
justification
for
the
study
Often
a
literature
review
is
conducted
in
a
given
subject
area
before
a
research
question
is
identified
A
gap
in
the
current
literature
as
identified
by
a
researcher
then
engenders
a
research
question
The
research
question
may
be
parallel
to
the
hypothesis
The
hypothesis
is
the
supposition
to
be
tested
The
researcher
s
collects
data
to
test
the
hypothesis
The
researcher
s
then
analyzes
and
interprets
the
data
via
a
variety
of
statistical
methods
engaging
in
what
is
known
as
empirical
research
The
results
of
the
data
analysis
in
rejecting
or
failing
to
reject
the
null
hypothesis
are
then
reported
and
evaluated
At
the
end
the
researcher
may
discuss
avenues
for
further
research
However
some
researchers
advocate
for
the
reverse
approach
starting
with
articulating
findings
and
discussion
of
them
moving
up
to
identification
of
a
research
problem
that
emerges
in
the
findings
and
literature
review
The
reverse
approach
is
justified
by
the
transactional
nature
of
the
research
endeavor
where
research
inquiry
research
questions
research
method
relevant
research
literature
and
so
on
are
not
fully
known
until
the
findings
have
fully
emerged
and
been
interpreted
Rudolph
Rummel
says
no
researcher
should
accept
any
one
or
two
tests
as
definitive
It
is
only
when
a
range
of
tests
are
consistent
over
many
kinds
of
data
researchers
and
methods
can
one
have
confidence
in
the
results
Plato
in
Meno
talks
about
an
inherent
difficulty
if
not
a
paradox
of
doing
research
that
can
be
paraphrased
in
the
following
way
If
you
know
what
you
re
searching
for
why
do
you
search
for
it
i
e
you
have
already
found
it
If

what

is
to

them
may

using
empirical
evidence
There
are
two
major
types
of
empirical
research
design
qualitative
research
and
quantitative
research
Researchers
choose
qualitative
or
quantitative
methods
according
to
the
nature
of
the
research
topic
they
want
to
investigate
and
the
research
questions
they
aim
to
answer
Qualitative
research
This
involves
understanding
human
behavior
and
the
reasons
that
govern
such
behavior
by
asking
a
broad
question
collecting
data
in
the
form
of
words
images
video
etc
that
is
analyzed
and
searching
for
themes
This
type
of
research
aims
to
investigate
a
question
without
attempting
to
quantifiably
measure
variables
or
look
to
potential
relationships
between
variables
It
is
viewed
as
more
restrictive
in
testing
hypotheses
because
it
can
be
expensive
and
time
consuming
and
typically
limited
to
a
single
set
of
research
subjects

Qualitative
research
is
often
used
as
a
method
of
exploratory
research
as

for
later
quantitative
research
hypotheses
citation
needed
Qualitative
research
is
linked
with
the
philosophical
and
theoretical
stance
of
social
constructionism
Social
media
posts
are
used
for
qualitative
research
Quantitative
research
This
involves
systematic
empirical
investigation
of
quantitative
properties
and
phenomena
and
their
relationships
by
asking
a
narrow
question
and
collecting
numerical
data
to
analyze
it
utilizing
statistical
methods
The
quantitative
research
designs
are
experimental
correlational
and
survey
or
descriptive
Statistics
derived
from
quantitative
research
can
be
used
to
establish
the
existence
of
associative
or
causal
relationships
between
variables
Quantitative
research
is
linked
with
the
philosophical
and
theoretical
stance
of
positivism
The
quantitative
data
collection
methods
rely
on
random
sampling
and
structured
data
collection
instruments
that
fit
diverse
experiences
into
predetermined
response
categories
citation
needed
These
methods
produce
results
that
are
easy
to
summarize
compare
and
generalize
citation
needed
Quantitative
research
is
concerned
with
testing
hypotheses
derived
from
theory
or
being
able
to
estimate
the
size
of
a
phenomenon
of
interest
If
the
research
question
is
about
people
participants
may
be
randomly
assigned
to
different
treatments
this
is
the
only
way
that
a
quantitative
study
can
be
considered
a
true
experiment
citation
needed
If
this
is
not
feasible
the
researcher
may
collect
data
on
participant
and
situational
characteristics
to
statistically
control
for
their
influence
on
the
dependent
or
outcome
variable
If
the
intent
is
to
generalize
from
the
research
participants
to
a
larger
population
the
researcher
will
employ
probability
sampling
to
select
participants
In
either
qualitative
or
quantitative
research
the
researcher
s
may
collect
primary
or
secondary
data
Primary
data
is
data
collected
specifically
for
the
research
such
as
through
interviews
or
questionnaires
Secondary
data
is
data
that
already
exists
such
as
census
data
which
can
be
re
used
for
the
research
It
is
good
ethical
research
practice
to
use
secondary
data
wherever
possible
Mixed
method
research
i
e
research
that
includes
qualitative
and
quantitative
elements
using
both
primary
and
secondary
data
is
becoming
more
common
This
method
has
benefits
that
using
one
method
alone
cannot
offer
For
example
a
researcher
may
choose
to
conduct
a
qualitative
study
and
follow
it
up
with
a
quantitative
study
to
gain
additional
insights
Big
data
has
brought
big
impacts
on
research
methods
so
that
now
many
researchers
do
not
put
much
effort
into
data
collection
furthermore
methods
to
analyze
easily
available
huge
amounts
of
data
have
also
been
developed
Non
empirical
research
Non
empirical
theoretical
research
is
an
approach
that
involves
the
development
of
theory
as
opposed
to
using
observation
and
experimentation
As
such
non
empirical
research
seeks
solutions
to
problems
using
existing
knowledge
as
its
source
This
however
does
not
mean
that
new
ideas
and
innovations
cannot
be
found
within
the
pool
of
existing
and
established
knowledge
Non
empirical
research
is
not
an
absolute
alternative
to
empirical
research
because
they
may
be
used
together
to
strengthen
a
research
approach
Neither
one
is
less
effective
than
the
other
since
they
have
their
particular
purpose
in
science
Typically
empirical
research
produces
observations
that
need
to
be
explained
then
theoretical
research
tries
to
explain
them
and
in
so
doing
generates
empirically
testable
hypotheses
these
hypotheses
are
then
tested
empirically
giving
more
observations
that
may
need
further
explanation
and
so
on
See
Scientific
method
A
simple
example
of
a
non
empirical
task
is
the
prototyping
of
a
new
drug
using
a
differentiated
application
of
existing
knowledge
another
is
the
development
of
a
business
process
in
the
form
of
a
flow
chart
and
texts
where
all
the
ingredients
are
from
established
knowledge
Much
of
cosmological
research
is
theoretical
in
nature
Mathematics
research
does
not
rely
on
externally
available
data
rather
it
seeks
to
prove
theorems
about
mathematical
objects
Research
ethics
Research
ethics
involves
the
application
of
fundamental
ethical
principles
to
a
variety
of
topics
involving
research
including
scientific
research
These
include
the
design
and
implementation
of
research
involving
human
experimentation
animal
experimentation
various
aspects
of
academic
scandal
including
scientific
misconduct
such
as
fraud
fabrication
of
data
and
plagiarism
whistleblowing
regulation
of
research
etc
Research
ethics
is
most
developed
as
a
concept
in
medical
research
The
key
agreement
here
is
the
Declaration
of
Helsinki
The
Nuremberg
Code
is
a
former
agreement
but
with
many
still
important
notes
Research
in
the
social
sciences
presents
a
different
set
of
issues
than
those
in
medical
research
and
can
involve
issues
of
researcher
and
participant
safety
empowerment
and
access
to
justice
When
research
involves
human
subjects
obtaining
informed
consent
from
them
is
essential

Methods

In
many
disciplines
Western
methods
of
conducting
research
are
predominant
Researchers
are
overwhelmingly
taught
Western
methods
of
data
collection
and
study
The
increasing
participation
of
indigenous
peoples
as
researchers
has
brought
increased
attention
to
the
lacuna
in
culturally
sensitive
methods
of
data
collection
Non
Western

of
data
collection
may
not
be
the
most
accurate
or
relevant
for
research
on
non
Western
societies
For
example
Hua
Oranga
was
created
as
a
criterion
for

in
M

Peer
review
is
a
form
of
self
regulation
by
qualified
members
of
a
profession
within
the
relevant
field
Peer
review
methods
are
employed
to
maintain
standards
of
quality
improve
performance
and
provide
credibility
In
academia
scholarly
peer
review
is
often
used
to
determine
an
academic
paper
s
suitability
for
publication
Usually
the
peer
review
process
involves
experts
in
the
same
field
who
are
consulted
by
editors
to
give
a
review
of
the
scholarly
works
produced
by
a
colleague
of
theirs
from
an
unbiased
and
impartial
point
of
view
and
this
is
usually
done
free
of
charge
The
tradition
of
peer
reviews
being
done
for
free
has
however
brought
many
pitfalls
which
are
also
indicative
of
why
most
peer
reviewers
decline
many
invitations
to
review
It
was
observed
that
publications
from
periphery
countries
rarely
rise
to
the
same
elite
status
as
those
of
North
America
and
Europe
because
limitations
on
the
availability
of
resources
including
high
quality
paper
and
sophisticated
image
rendering
software
and
printing
tools
render
these
publications
less
able
to
satisfy
standards
currently
carrying
formal
or
informal
authority
in
the
publishing
industry
These
limitations
in
turn
result
in
the
under
representation
of
scholars
from
periphery
nations
among
the
set
of
publications
holding
prestige
status
relative
to
the
quantity
and
quality
of
those
scholars
research
efforts
and
this
under
representation
in
turn
results
in
disproportionately
reduced
acceptance
of
the
results
of
their
efforts
as
contributions
to
the
body
of
knowledge
available
worldwide
Influence
of
the
open
access
movement
The
open
access
movement
assumes
that
all
information
generally
deemed
useful
should
be
free
and
belongs
to
a
public
domain
that
of
humanity
This
idea
gained
prevalence
as
a
result
of
Western
colonial
history
and
ignores
alternative
conceptions
of
knowledge
circulation
For
instance
most
indigenous
communities
consider
that
access
to
certain
information
proper
to
the
group
should
be
determined
by
relationships
There
is
alleged
to
be
a
double
standard
in
the
Western
knowledge
system
On
the
one
hand
digital
right
management
used
to
restrict
access
to
personal
information
on
social
networking
platforms
is
celebrated
as
a
protection
of
privacy
while
simultaneously
when
similar
functions
are
utilised
by
cultural
groups
i
e
indigenous
communities
this
is
denounced
as
access
control
and
reprehended
as
censorship
Future
perspectives
Even
though
Western
dominance
seems
to
be
prominent
in
research
some
scholars
such
as
Simon
Marginson
argue
for
the
need
for
a
plural
university
world
Marginson
argues
that
the
East
Asian
Confucian
model
could
take
over
the
Western
model
This
could
be
due
to
changes
in
funding
for
research
both
in
the
East
and
the
West
Focussed
on
emphasizing
educational
achievement
East
Asian
cultures
mainly
in
China
and
South
Korea
have
encouraged
the
increase
of
funding
for
research
expansion
In
contrast
in
the
Western
academic
world
notably
in
the
United
Kingdom
as
well
as
in
some
state
governments
in
the
United
States
funding
cuts
for
university
research
have
occurred
which
some
who
say
may
lead
to
the
future
decline
of
Western
dominance

research

Academic
publishing
is
a
system
that
is
necessary
for
academic
scholars
to
peer
review
the
work
and
make
it
available
for
a
wider
audience
The
system
varies
widely
by
field
and
is
also
always
changing
if
often
slowly
Most
academic
work
is
published
in
journal
article
or
book
form
There
is
also
a
large
body
of
research
that
exists
in
either
a
thesis
or
dissertation
form
These
forms
of
research
can
be
found
in
databases
explicitly
for
theses
and
dissertations
In
publishing
STM
publishing
is
an
abbreviation
for
academic
publications
in
science
technology
and
medicine
Most
established
academic
fields
have
their
own
scientific
journals
and
other
outlets
for
publication
though
many
academic
journals
are
somewhat
interdisciplinary
and
publish
work
from
several
distinct
fields
or
subfields
The
kinds
of
publications
that
are
accepted
as
contributions
of
knowledge
or
research
vary
greatly
between
fields
from
the
print
to
the
electronic
format
A
study
suggests
that
researchers
should
not
give
great
consideration
to
findings
that
are
not
replicated
frequently
It
has
also
been
suggested
that
all
published
studies
should
be
subjected
to
some
measure
for
assessing
the
validity
or
reliability
of
its
procedures
to
prevent
the
publication
of
unproven
findings
Business
models
are
different
in
the
electronic
environment
Since
about
the
early
s
licensing
of
electronic
resources
particularly
journals
has
been
very
common
Presently
a
major
trend
particularly
with
respect
to
scholarly
journals
is
open
access
There
are
two
main
forms
of
open
access
open
access
publishing
in
which
the
articles
or
the
whole
journal
is
freely
available
from
the
time
of
publication
and
self
archiving
where
the
author
makes
a
copy
of
their
own
work
freely
available
on
the
web
Research
funding
Main
article
Funding
of
science
Most
funding
for
scientific
research
comes
from
three
major
sources
corporate
research
and
development
departments
private
foundations
for
example
the
Bill
and
Melinda
Gates
Foundation
and
government
research
councils
such
as
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
in
the
USA
and
the
Medical
Research
Council
in
the
UK
These
are
managed
primarily
through
universities
and
in
some
cases
through
military
contractors
Many
senior
researchers
such
as
group
leaders
spend
a
significant
amount
of
their
time
applying
for
grants
for
research
funds
These
grants
are
necessary
not
only
for
researchers
to
carry
out
their
research
but
also
as
a
source
of
merit

The

was
launched
at
p

on

After
an
introduction
by
Ted
Turner
the
husband
and
wife
team
of
David
Walker
and
Lois
Hart
anchored
the
channel
s
first
newscast
Burt
Reinhardt
the
executive
vice
president
of
CNN
at
its
launch
hired
most
of
the
channel
s
first
employees
including
the
network
s
first
news
anchor
Bernard
Shaw
Since
its
debut
CNN
has
expanded
its
reach
to
a
number
of
cable
and
satellite
television
providers
several
websites
and
specialized
closed
circuit
channels
such
as
CNN
Airport
The
company
has
bureaus
domestic
international
more
than
affiliated
local
stations
which
also
receive
news
and
features
content
via
the
video
newswire
service
CNN
Newsource
and
several
regional
and
foreign
language
networks
around
the
world
The
channel
s
success
made
a
bona
fide
mogul
of
founder
Ted
Turner
and
set
the
stage
for
conglomerate
Time
Warner
s
eventual
acquisition
of
the
Turner
Broadcasting
System
in
A
companion
channel
CNN
was
launched
on
January
and
featured
a
continuous
hour
cycle
of
minute
news
broadcasts
The
channel
which
later
became
known
as
CNN
Headline
News
and
is
now
known
as
simply
HLN
eventually
focused
on
live

Gulf
War
The
first
Persian
Gulf
War
in
was
a
watershed
event
for
CNN
that
catapulted
the
channel
past
the
Big
Three
American
networks
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
largely
due
to
an
unprecedented
historical
scoop
CNN
was
the
only
news
outlet
with
the
ability
to
communicate
from
inside
Iraq
during
the
initial
hours
of
the

s

radio
reports
of

the
lack

CNN
s
coverage
was
carried
by
television
stations
and
networks
around
the
world
resulting
in
CNN
being
watched
by
over
a

viewers
worldwide
The

experience
brought
CNN
some

The
stage
for
the
second

Leading
up
to
the
U

election
CNN
devoted
large
amounts
of
its
coverage
to
politics
including
hosting
candidate
debates
during
the
Democratic
and
Republican
primary
seasons
On
June
and
CNN
teamed
up
with
Saint

College
to
sponsor
the

Later
in

U

election
Driven
by
live
coverage
of
the
year
s
US
presidential
election
was
CNN
s
most
watched
year
in
its
history
Throughout
the
campaign
the
network
aired
unedited
coverage
of
many
of
the
Trump
campaign
rallies
Aides
for
Republican
candidates
Marco
Rubio
Jeb
Bush
and
Ted
Cruz
accused
CNN
president
Jeff
Zucker
of
undermining
their
candidates
during
the
Republican
primaries
After
the
election
Zucker
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
air
so
many
of
the
campaign
rallies
CNN
also
drew
criticism
during
the
election
for
hiring
former
Trump
campaign
manager
Corey
Lewandowski
who
was
still
being
paid
by
and
was
effectively
working
on
behalf
of
the
campaign
Trump
administration
AT
T
purchase
The
presidency
of
Donald
Trump
has
led
to
many
prominent
controversies
involving
CNN
The
network
was
accused
by
critics
of
giving
disproportionate
amounts
of
coverage
to
Donald
Trump
and
democratic
candidate
Hillary
Clinton
CNN
president
Jeff
Zucker
defended
the
criticism
arguing
that
out
of
the
Republican
candidates
Trump
was
the
most
willing
to
give
on
air
interviews
Trump
commented
upon
the
allegations
during
his
speech
at
the
Conservative
Political
Action
Conference
CPAC
jokingly
referring
to
CNN
as
the
Clinton
News
Network
In
January
CNN
reported
that
Trump
had
been
briefed
on
a
classified
dossier
which
detailed
compromising
personal
and
financial
information
that
had
allegedly
been
obtained
by
the
Russian
government
While
CNN
did
not
publish
the
dossier
Trump
criticized
the
network
during
a
press
conference
the
following
day
and
refused
to
take
a
question
from
CNN
reporter
Jim
Acosta
claiming
that
the
network
was
fake
news
On
June
CNN
investigative
journalists
Thomas
Frank
Eric
Lichtblau
and
Lex
Haris
voluntarily
resigned
after
the
network
retracted
an
online
article
which
incorrectly
connected
Trump
aide
Anthony
Scaramucci
to
a
billion
Russian
investment
fund
The
network
apologized
to
Scaramucci
and
admitted
that
the
online
story
did
not
meet
their
editorial
standards
Zucker
responded
by
stressing
that
the
network
needs
to
play
error
free
ball
when
it
comes
to
any
future
stories
about
Trump
In
July
Trump
posted
a
video
on
Twitter
of
himself
tackling
Vince
McMahon
on
the
ground
during
WrestleMania
edited
to
replace
McMahon
s
face
with
a
CNN
logo
The
clip
was
considered
to
be
a
further
expression
of
his
opinions
regarding
the
network
s
quality
of
coverage
Several
media
columnists
and
Democratic
politicians
condemned
the
retweeted
video
concerned
that
its
substance
given
the
tone
of
some
of
Trump
s
criticism
of
mainstream
media
outlets
for
what
he
deems
as
unfavorable
coverage
of
him
and
his
presidency
could
encourage
some
of
his
extreme
right
wing
supporters
to
commit
violence
against
journalists
from
outlets
outside
of
the
conservative
media
spectrum
Later
that
month
a
group
of
Democratic
United
States
Senators
led
by
Amy
Klobuchar
issued
a
request
for
information
over
allegations
that
the
Trump
administration
was
planning
to
use
CNN
as
leverage
for
political
gain
in
the
process
of
clearing
the
proposed
acquisition
of
its
parent
company
Time
Warner
by
AT
T
a
purchase
which
was
first
announced
in
October
The
Daily
Caller
reported
that
in
particular
the
administration
was
seeking
the
removal
of
Jeff
Zucker
as
CNN
president
Although
Trump
had
promised
to
block
the
acquisition
entirely
during
his
presidential
campaign
Trump
s
transition
team
later
stated
that
the
government
planned
to
evaluate
the
deal
without
prejudice
Following
the
announcement
of
the
acquisition
AT
T
CEO
Randall
L
Stephenson
stated
that
the
company
was
committed
to
continuing
the
editorial
independence
of
CNN
In
August
Deadline
Hollywood
reported
that
AT
T
had
considered
spinning
off
CNN
and
its
stake
in
TMZ
post
acquisition
In
October
Stephenson
downplayed
the
possibility
that
the
ongoing
tensions
between
Trump
and
CNN
could
affect
the
deal
stating
that
he
didn
t
know
what
the
relevance
of
CNN
is
in
terms
of
an
antitrust
review
and
that
AT
T
did
not
plan
to
make
managerial
changes
to
Time
Warner
properties
that
were
operating
well
such
as
CNN
Later
that
month
CNN
launched
a
new
promotional
campaign
Facts
First
in
an
effort
to
combat
false
perceptions
over
the
quality
of
its
reporting
Using
an
apple
to
demonstrate
metaphors
for
fake
news
and
alternative
facts
in
particular
suggesting
that
one
could
persistently
opine
that
the
apple
was
actually
a
banana
the
ads
publicize
a
commitment
to
accurate
fact
based
reporting
The
ad
became
the
subject
of
parodies
including
one
by
The
Daily
Caller
which
reversed
the
ad
and
amended
the
slogan
with
unless
we
are
reporting
on
Trump
and
Stephen
Colbert
which
closed
with
the
line
Now
orange
you
ready
to
impeach
and
was
criticized
by
conservative
publishers
Republican
politicians
and
on
social
media
On
November
Stephenson
met
with
Makan
Delrahim
assistant
Attorney
General
of
the
United
States
Department
of
Justice
Antitrust
Division
to
discuss
antitrust
and
concentration
of
media
ownership
concerns
surrounding
the
acquisition
and
possible
options
for
satisfying
them
Two
days
later
major
media
outlets
publicly
reported
that
the
Justice
Department
had
recommended
that
either
the
entire
Turner
Broadcasting
group
or
DirecTV
be
divested
as
a
condition
of
the
merger
The
Financial
Times
went
further
stating
that
it
had
specifically
demanded
the
divestment
of
CNN
Stephenson
denied
these
reports
stating
that
he
never
offered
to
nor
had
any
intentions
to
sell
CNN
CNN
s
media
analyst
Brian
Stelter
noted
that
media
outlets
were
interpreting
the
alleged
recommendations
as
being
either
a
genuine
concern
for
AT
T
s
scale
following
the
merger
or
a
retaliatory
measure
by
the
Trump
administration
against
CNN
At
the
DealBook
conference
in
New
York
City
the
next
day
Stephenson
denied
that
the
Department
had
demanded
the
divestment
of
CNN
at
all
stating
that
he
had
never
been
told
that
the
price
of
getting
the
deal
done
was
selling
CNN
and
that
the
company
aimed
to
get
to
a
negotiated
settlement
However
he
stated
that
if
they
were
unable
to
do
so
AT
T
was
prepared
to
litigate
In
a
statement
to
CNBC
a
Department
of
Justice
official
backed
Stephenson
denying
that
there
were
any
specific
demands
to
divest
CNN
during
the
discussion
and
considering
the
claims
to
be
shocking
and
an
attempt
to
politicize
the
situation
The
official
added
that
the
Department
had
officially
recommended
either
abandoning
the
deal
entirely
or
divesting
DirecTV
or
Turner
but
that
it
was
open
to
other
options
for
quelling
antitrust
concerns
The
same
day
the
watchdog
group
Protect
Democracy
sued
the
Department
of
Justice
to
seek
information
on
whether
the
Trump
administration
had
improperly
interfered
with
the
Department
s
review
of
the
merger
between
AT
T
and
Time
Warner
or
has
acted
in
that
matter
based
on
the
President
s
personal
dislike
of
CNN
s
protected
speech
The
group
had
issued
a
Freedom
of
Information
Act
request
for
these
details
but
the
Department
had
not
responded
On
November
the
Department
of
Justice
filed
an
antitrust
lawsuit
over
the
acquisition

In
December
CNN
introduced
a
comprehensive
redesign
of
its
on
air
appearance
which
replaced
an
existing
style
that
had
been
used
since
On

graphics
took
a
rounded
flat
look
in
a
predominantly
black
white

scheme
and

next

the
CNN
logo
for
displaying
show
logos
and
segment
specific
graphics
rather
than
as
a
large

above
the

The
redesign
also
replaced
the
scrolling
ticker
with
a
static
flipper
which
could
either
display
a
feed
of
news
headlines
both
manually
inserted
and
taken
from
the
RSS
feeds
of
CNN
com
or
topical
details
related
to
a

CNN
s
next
major
redesign
was
introduced
on
January
replacing
the
dark
flat
appearance
of
the
look
with
a
glossier
blue
and
white
color
scheme
and
moving
the
secondary
logo
box
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
screen
Additionally
the

began
to
solely
produce
its
programming
in
the
aspect
ratio
with
standard
definition
feeds
using
a
letterboxed
version
of

On
February
the
flipper
was
dropped
and
reverted
to
a
scrolling
ticker
originally
displayed
as
a
blue
background
with
white
text
the
ticker
was
reconfigured
a
day
later
with
blue
text
on
a
white
background
to
match
the
look
of
the
flipper
On
August
CNN
introduced
its
most
recent
graphics
package
dropping
the
glossy
appearance
for
a
flat
rectangular
scheme
incorporating
red
white
and
black
colors
and
the
Gotham
typeface
The
ticker
now
alternates
between
general
headlines
and
financial
news
from
CNNMoney
and
the
secondary
logo
box
was
replaced
with
a
smaller
box
below
the
CNN
bug
which
displays
either
the
title
hashtag
or
Twitter
handle
for
the
show
being

CNN
began
to

November
In
a
joint
study
by
the
Joan
Shorenstein
Center
on
Press
Politics
and
Public
Policy
at
Harvard
University
and
the
Project
for
Excellence
in
Journalism
the
authors
found
disparate
treatment
by
the
three
major
cable
channels
of
Republican
and
Democratic
candidates
during
the
earliest
five
months
of
presidential
primaries
in
The
CNN
programming
studied
tended
to
cast
a
negative
light
on
Republican
candidates
C
by
a
margin
of
three
to
one
Four
in
ten
stories
were
clearly
negative
while
just
were
positive
and
were
neutral
The
network
provided
negative
coverage
of
all
three
main
candidates
with
McCain
faring
the
worst
negative
and
Romney
faring
a
little
better
than
the
others
only
because
a
majority
of
his
coverage
was
neutral
It
s
not
that
Democrats
other
than
Obama
fared
well
on
CNN
either
Nearly
half
of
the
Illinois
Senator
s
stories
were
positive
vs
just
that
were
negative
But
both
Clinton
and
Edwards
ended
up
with
more
negative
than
positive
coverage
overall
So
while
coverage
for
Democrats
overall
was
a
bit
more
positive
than
negative
that
was
almost
all
due
to
extremely
favorable
coverage
for
Obama
CNN
President
Walter
Isaacson
met
with
Republican
Party
leaders
in
Washington
DC
in
saying
afterwards
I
was
trying
to
reach
out
to
a
lot
of
Republicans
who
feel
that
CNN
has
not
been
as
open
covering
Republicans
and
I
wanted
to
hear
their
concerns
As
CNN
founder
Ted
Turner
stated
There
really
isn
t
much
of
a
point
getting
some
Tom
Dick
or
Harry
off
the
streets
to
report
on
when
we
can
snag
a
big
name
whom
everyone
identifies
with
After
all
it
s
all
part
of
the
business
However
in
April
Turner
criticized
the
direction
that
CNN
has
taken
In
October
WikiLeaks
published
emails
from
John
Podesta
which
showed
CNN
contributor
Donna
Brazile
passing
the
questions
for
a
CNN
sponsored
debate
to
the
Clinton
campaign
In
the
email
Brazile
discussed
her
concern
of
Clinton
s
ability
to
field
a
question
regarding
the
death
penalty
The
following
day
Clinton
would
receive
the
question
about
the
death
penalty
verbatim
from
an
audience
member
at
the
CNN
hosted
Town
Hall
event
According
to
a
CNNMoney
investigation
the
debate
moderator
Roland
Martin
of
TV
One
did
not
deny
sharing
information
with
Brazile
CNN
severed

Deep
learning
is
a
class
of
machine
learning
algorithms
that
pp
C
use
a
cascade
of
multiple
layers
of
nonlinear
processing
units
for
feature
extraction
and
transformation
Each
successive
layer
uses
the
output
from
the
previous
layer
as
input
learn
in
supervised
e
g
classification
and
or
unsupervised
e
g
pattern
analysis
manners
learn
multiple
levels
of
representations
that
correspond
to
different
levels
of
abstraction
the
levels
form
a
hierarchy
of
concepts
Overview
Most
modern
deep
learning
models
are
based
on
an
artificial
neural
network
although
they
can
also
include
propositional
formulas
or
latent
variables
organized
layer
wise
in
deep
generative
models
such
as
the
nodes
in
Deep
Belief
Networks
and
Deep
Boltzmann
Machines
In
deep
learning
each
level
learns
to
transform
its
input
data
into
a
slightly
more
abstract
and
composite
representation
In
an
image
recognition
application
the
raw
input
may
be
a
matrix
of
pixels
the
first
representational
layer
may
abstract
the
pixels
and
encode
edges
the
second
layer
may
compose
and
encode
arrangements
of
edges
the
third
layer
may
encode
a
nose
and
eyes
and
the
fourth
layer
may
recognize
that
the
image
contains
a
face
Importantly
a
deep
learning
process
can
learn
which
features
to
optimally
place
in
which
level
on
its
own
Of
course
this
does
not
completely
obviate
the
need
for
hand
tuning
for
example
varying
numbers
of
layers
and
layer
sizes
can
provide
different
degrees
of
abstraction
The
deep
in
deep
learning
refers
to
the
number
of
layers
through
which
the
data
is
transformed
More
precisely
deep
learning
systems
have
a
substantial
credit
assignment
path
CAP
depth
The
CAP
is
the
chain
of
transformations
from
input
to
output
CAPs
describe
potentially
causal
connections
between
input
and
output
For
a
feedforward
neural
network
the
depth
of
the
CAPs
is
that
of
the
network
and
is
the
number
of
hidden
layers
plus
one
as
the
output
layer
is
also
parameterized
For
recurrent
neural
networks
in
which
a
signal
may
propagate
through
a
layer
more
than
once
the
CAP
depth
is
potentially
unlimited
No
universally
agreed
upon
threshold
of
depth
divides
shallow
learning
from
deep
learning
but
most
researchers
agree
that
deep
learning
involves
CAP
depth
CAP
of
depth
has
been
shown
to
be
a
universal
approximator
in
the
sense
that
it
can
emulate
any
function
citation
needed
Beyond
that
more
layers
do
not
add
to
the
function
approximator
ability
of
the
network
The
extra
layers
help
in
learning
features
Deep
learning
architectures
are
often
constructed
with
a
greedy
layer
by
layer
method
clarification
needed
further
explanation
needed
citation
needed
Deep
learning
helps
to
disentangle
these
abstractions
and
pick
out
which
features
improve
performance
For
supervised
learning
tasks
deep
learning
methods
obviate
feature
engineering
by
translating
the
data
into
compact
intermediate
representations
akin
to
principal
components
and
derive
layered
structures
that
remove
redundancy
in
representation
Deep
learning
algorithms
can
be
applied
to
unsupervised
learning
tasks
This
is
an
important
benefit
because
unlabeled
data
are
more
abundant
than
labeled
data
Examples
of
deep
structures
that
can
be
trained
in
an
unsupervised
manner
are
neural
history
compressors
and
deep
belief
networks
Interpretations
Deep
neural
networks
are
generally
interpreted
in
terms
of
the
universal
approximation
theorem
or
probabilistic
inference
The
universal
approximation
theorem
concerns
the
capacity
of
feedforward
neural
networks
with
a
single
hidden
layer
of
finite
size
to
approximate
continuous
functions
In
the
first
proof
was
published
by
George
Cybenko
for
sigmoid
activation
functions
and
was
generalised
to
feed
forward
multi
layer
architectures
in
by
Kurt
Hornik
The
probabilistic
interpretation
derives
from
the
field
of
machine
learning
It
features
inference
as
well
as
the
optimization
concepts
of
training
and
testing
related
to
fitting
and
generalization
respectively
More
specifically
the
probabilistic
interpretation
considers
the
activation
nonlinearity
as
a
cumulative
distribution
function
The
probabilistic
interpretation
led
to
the
introduction
of
dropout
as
regularizer
in
neural
networks
The
probabilistic
interpretation
was
introduced
by
researchers
including
Hopfield
Widrow
and
Narendra
and
popularized
in
surveys
such
as
the
one
by
Bishop
History
The
term
Deep
Learning
was
introduced
to
the
machine
learning
community
by
Rina
Dechter
in
and
to
Artificial
Neural
Networks
by
Igor
Aizenberg
and
colleagues
in
in
the
context
of
Boolean
threshold
neurons
The
first
general
working
learning
algorithm
for
supervised
deep
feedforward
multilayer
perceptrons
was
published
by
Alexey
Ivakhnenko
and
Lapa
in
A
paper
described
a
deep
network
with
layers
trained
by
the
group
method
of
data
handling
algorithm
Other
deep
learning
working
architectures
specifically
those
built
for
computer
vision
began
with
the
Neocognitron
introduced
by
Kunihiko
Fukushima
in
In
Yann
LeCun
et
al
applied
the
standard
backpropagation
algorithm
which
had
been
around
as
the
reverse
mode
of
automatic
differentiation
since
to
a
deep
neural
network
with
the
purpose
of
recognizing
handwritten
ZIP
codes
on
mail
While
the
algorithm
worked
training
required
days
By
such
systems
were
used
for
recognizing
isolated
D
hand
written
digits
while
recognizing
D
objects
was
done
by
matching
D
images
with
a
handcrafted
D
object
model
Weng
et
al
suggested
that
a
human
brain
does
not
use
a
monolithic
D
object
model
and
in
they
published
Cresceptron
a
method
for
performing
D
object
recognition
in
cluttered
scenes
Cresceptron
is
a
cascade
of
layers
similar
to
Neocognitron
But
while
Neocognitron
required
a
human
programmer
to
hand
merge
features
Cresceptron
learned
an
open
number
of
features
in
each
layer
without
supervision
where
each
feature
is
represented
by
a
convolution
kernel
Cresceptron
segmented
each
learned
object
from
a
cluttered
scene
through
back
analysis
through
the
network
Max
pooling
now
often
adopted
by
deep
neural
networks
e
g
ImageNet
tests
was
first
used
in
Cresceptron
to
reduce
the
position
resolution
by
a
factor
of
x
to
through
the
cascade
for
better
generalization
In
Andr
de
Carvalho
together
with
Mike
Fairhurst
and
David
Bisset
published
experimental
results
of
a
multi
layer
boolean
neural
network
also
known
as
a
weightless
neural
network
composed
of
a
layers
self
organising
feature
extraction
neural
network
module
SOFT
followed
by
a
multi
layer
classification
neural
network
module
GSN
which
were
independently
trained
Each
layer
in
the
feature
extraction
module
extracted
features
with
growing
complexity
regarding
the
previous
layer
In
Brendan
Frey
demonstrated
that
it
was
possible
to
train
over
two
days
a
network
containing
six
fully
connected
layers
and
several
hundred
hidden
units
using
the
wake
sleep
algorithm
co
developed
with
Peter
Dayan
and
Hinton
Many
factors
contribute
to
the
slow
speed
including
the
vanishing
gradient
problem
analyzed
in
by
Sepp
Hochreiter
Simpler
models
that
use
task
specific
handcrafted
features
such
as
Gabor
filters
and
support
vector
machines
SVMs
were
a
popular
choice
in
the
s
and
s
because
of
ANNs
computational
cost
and
a
lack
of
understanding
of
how
the
brain
wires
its
biological
networks
Both
shallow
and
deep
learning
e
g
recurrent
nets
of
ANNs
have
been
explored
for
many
years
These
methods
never
outperformed
non
uniform
internal
handcrafting
Gaussian
mixture
model
Hidden
Markov
model
GMM
HMM
technology
based
on
generative
models
of
speech
trained
discriminatively
Key
difficulties
have
been
analyzed
including
gradient
diminishing
and
weak
temporal
correlation
structure
in
neural
predictive
models
Additional
difficulties
were
the
lack
of
training
data
and
limited
computing
power
Most
speech
recognition
researchers
moved
away
from
neural
nets
to
pursue
generative
modeling
An
exception
was
at
SRI
International

the
late
s
Funded
by
the
US

The
impact
of
deep

in
industry
began
in
the
early
s
when
CNNs
already
processed
an
estimated

written

according
to

LeCun
Industrial
applications
of
deep
learning
to
large
scale
speech
recognition
started
around
The
NIPS
Workshop
on
Deep
Learning
for
Speech
Recognition
was
motivated
by
the
limitations
of
deep
generative
models
of
speech
and
the
possibility
that
given
more
capable
hardware
and
large
scale
data
sets
that
deep
neural
nets
DNN
might
become
practical
It
was
believed
that
pre
training
DNNs
using
generative
models
of
deep
belief
nets
DBN
would
overcome
the
main
difficulties
of
neural
nets
However
it
was
discovered
that
replacing
pre
training
with
large
amounts
of
training
data
for
straightforward
backpropagation
when
using
DNNs
with
large
context
dependent
output
layers
produced
error
rates
dramatically
lower
than
then
state
of
the
art
Gaussian
mixture
model
GMM
Hidden
Markov
Model
HMM
and
also
than
more
advanced
generative
model
based
systems
The
nature
of
the
recognition
errors
produced
by
the
two
types
of
systems
was
characteristically
different
offering
technical
insights
into
how
to
integrate
deep
learning
into
the
existing
highly
efficient
run

speech
decoding
system
deployed
by
all
major
speech
recognition
systems
Analysis
around
contrasted
the
GMM
and
other
generative
speech
models
vs
DNN
models
stimulated
early
industrial
investment
in
deep
learning
for
speech
recognition
eventually
leading
to
pervasive
and
dominant
use
in
that
industry
That
analysis
was
done
with
comparable
performance
less
than
in
error
rate
between
discriminative
DNNs
and
generative
models
In
researchers
extended
deep
learning
from
TIMIT
to
large
vocabulary
speech
recognition
by
adopting
large
output
layers
of
the
DNN
based
on

constructed
by

Advances
in
hardware
enabled
the
renewed
interest
In
Nvidia
was
involved
in
what
was
called
the
big
bang
of
deep
learning
as
deep

were
trained
with
Nvidia

That
year
Google

to
create

While
there
Ng
determined
that
GPUs
could
increase
the
speed
of
deep

systems
by
about
times
In

GPUs
are
well

up

reducing

to

can
be
used
for

but
in
June
a

by

at

showed
how

can
dramatically

by
Krizhevsky

by
a
significant
margin
over

also
won
the

of
large

and
in
the

also
the
MICCAI
Grand

on
the

In
and
the
error
rate
on
the
ImageNet
task
using
deep
learning
was
further
reduced
following
a
similar
trend
in
large

The
Wolfram
Image

publicized
these
improvements
Image

then
extended
to
the

A
deep
neural
network
DNN
is
an
artificial
neural
network
ANN
with
multiple
hidden
layers
between
the
input
and
output
layers
DNNs
can
model
complex
non
linear
relationships
DNN
architectures
generate
compositional
models
where
the
object
is
expressed
as
a
layered
composition
of
primitives
The
extra
layers
enable
composition
of
features
from
lower
layers
potentially
modeling
complex
data
with
fewer
units
than
a
similarly
performing
shallow
network
Deep
architectures
include
many
variants
of
a
few
basic
approaches
Each
architecture
has
found
success
in
specific
domains
It
is
not
always
possible
to
compare
the
performance
of
multiple
architectures
unless
they
have
been
evaluated
on
the
same
data
sets
DNNs
are
typically
feedforward
networks
in
which
data
flows
from
the
input
layer
to
the
output
layer
without
looping
back
Recurrent
neural
networks
RNNs
in
which
data
can
flow
in
any
direction
are
used
for
applications
such
as
language
modeling
Long

is
particularly
effective
for
this
use
Convolutional

are

have
been

Challenges
As
with
ANNs
many
issues
can
arise
with
naively
trained
DNNs
Two
common
issues
are
overfitting
and
computation
time
DNNs
are
prone
to
overfitting
because
of
the
added
layers
of
abstraction
which
allow
them
to
model
rare
dependencies
in
the
training
data
Regularization
methods
such
as
Ivakhnenko
s
unit
pruning
or
weight
decay
displaystyle
ell
ell
regularization
or
sparsity
displaystyle
ell
ell
regularization
can
be
applied
during
training
to
combat
overfitting
Alternatively
dropout
regularization
randomly
omits
units
from
the
hidden
layers
during
training
This
helps
to
exclude
rare
dependencies
Finally
data
can
be
augmented
via
methods
such
as
cropping
and
rotating
such
that
smaller
training
sets
can
be
increased
in
size
to
reduce
the
chances
of
overfitting
DNNs
must
consider
many
training
parameters
such
as
the
size
number
of
layers
and
number
of
units
per
layer
the
learning
rate
and
initial
weights
Sweeping
through
the
parameter
space
for
optimal
parameters
may
not
be
feasible
due
to
the
cost
in
time
and
computational
resources
Various
tricks
such
as
batching
computing
the
gradient
on
several
training
examples
at
once
rather
than
individual
examples
speed
up
computation
Large
processing
capabilities
of
many
core
architectures
such
as
GPUs
or
the
Intel
Xeon
Phi
have
produced
significant
speedups
in
training
because
of
the
suitability
of
such
processing
architectures
for
the
matrix
and
vector
computations
Alternatively
engineers
may
look
for
other
types
of
neural
networks
with
more
straightforward
and
convergent
training
algorithms
CMAC
cerebellar
model
articulation
controller
is
one
such
kind
of
neural
network
It
doesn
t
require
learning
rates
or
randomized
initial
weights
for
CMAC
The
training
process
can
be
guaranteed
to
converge
in
one
step
with
a
new
batch
of
data
and
the
computational
complexity
of
the
training
algorithm
is
linear
with
respect
to
the
number
of
neurons
involved

Reliability
of
infrastructure
systems
Natural
disasters
can
have
catastrophic
impacts
on
the
functionality
of
infrastructure
systems
and
cause
severe
physical
and
socio
economic
losses
Given
budget
constraints
it
is
crucial
to
optimize
decisions
regarding
mitigation
preparedness
response
and
recovery
practices
for
these
systems
This
requires
accurate
and
efficient
means
to
evaluate
the

reliability
Deep
neural

used
for

Relation
to
human
cognitive
and
brain
development
Deep
learning
is
closely
related
to
a
class
of
theories
of
brain
development
specifically
neocortical
development
proposed
by
cognitive
neuroscientists
in
the
early
s
These
developmental
theories
were
instantiated
in
computational
models
making
them
predecessors
of
deep
learning
systems
These
developmental
models
share
the
property
that
various
proposed
learning
dynamics
in
the
brain
e
g
a
wave
of
nerve
growth
factor
support
the
self
organization
somewhat
analogous
to
the
neural
networks
utilized
in
deep
learning
models
Like
the
neocortex
neural
networks
employ
a
hierarchy
of
layered
filters
in
which
each
layer
considers
information
from
a
prior
layer
or
the
operating
environment
and
then
passes
its
output
and
possibly
the
original
input
to
other
layers
This
process
yields
a
self
organizing
stack
of
transducers
well
tuned
to
their
operating
environment
A
description
stated
the
infant
s
brain
seems
to
organize
itself
under
the
influence
of
waves
of
so
called
trophic
factors
different
regions
of
the
brain
become
connected
sequentially
with
one
layer
of
tissue
maturing
before
another
and
so
on
until
the
whole
brain
is
mature
A
variety
of
approaches
have
been
used
to
investigate
the
plausibility
of
deep
learning
models
from
a
neurobiological
perspective
On
the
one
hand
several
variants
of
the
backpropagation
algorithm
have
been
proposed
in
order
to
increase
its
processing
realism
Other
researchers
have
argued
that
unsupervised
forms
of
deep
learning
such
as
those
based
on
hierarchical
generative
models
and
deep
belief
networks
may
be
closer
to
biological
reality
In
this
respect
generative
neural
network
models
have
been
related
to
neurobiological
evidence
about
sampling
based
processing
in
the
cerebral
cortex
Although
a
systematic
comparison
between
the
human
brain
organization
and
the
neuronal
encoding
in
deep
networks
has
not
yet
been
established
several
analogies
have
been
reported
For
example
the
computations
performed
by
deep
learning
units
could
be
similar
to
those
of
actual
neurons
and
neural
populations
Similarly
the
representations
developed
by
deep
learning
models
are
similar
to
those
measured
in
the
primate
visual
system
both
at
the
single
unit
and
at
the
population
levels
Commercial
activity
Many
organizations
employ
deep
learning
for
particular
applications
Facebook
s
AI
lab
performs
tasks
such
as
automatically
tagging
uploaded
pictures
with
the
names
of
the
people
in
them
Google
s
DeepMind
Technologies
developed
a
system
capable
of
learning
how
to
play
Atari
video
games
using
only
pixels
as
data
input
In
they
demonstrated
their
AlphaGo
system
which
learned
the
game
of
Go
well
enough
to
beat
a
professional
Go
player
Google
Translate
uses
an
LSTM
to
translate
between
more
than
languages
In
Blippar
demonstrated
a
mobile
augmented
reality
application
that
uses
deep
learning
to
recognize
objects
in
real
time
Criticism
and
comment
Deep
learning
has
attracted
both
criticism
and
comment
in
some
cases
from
outside
the
field
of
computer
science
Theory

A
main
criticism
concerns
the
lack
of
theory
surrounding
the
methods
citation
needed
Learning
in
the
most
common
deep
architectures
is
implemented
using
well
understood
gradient
descent
However
the
theory
surrounding
other
algorithms
such
as
contrastive

is
less
clear

e
g
Does

so

What
is
it
approximating
Deep
learning
methods
are
often
looked
at
as
a
black
box
with
most
confirmations
done
empirically
rather
than
theoretically
Others
point
out
that
deep
learning
should
be
looked
at
as
a
step
towards
realizing
strong
AI
not
as
an
all
encompassing
solution
Despite
the
power
of
deep
learning
methods
they
still
lack
much
of
the
functionality
needed
for
realizing
this
goal
entirely
Research
psychologist
Gary
Marcus
noted
Realistically
deep
learning
is
only
part
of
the
larger
challenge
of
building
intelligent
machines
Such
techniques
lack
ways
of
representing
causal
relationships
have
no
obvious
ways
of
performing
logical
inferences
and
they
are
also
still
a
long
way
from
integrating
abstract
knowledge
such
as
information
about
what
objects
are
what
they
are
for
and
how
they
are
typically
used
The
most
powerful
A
I
systems
like
Watson
use
techniques
like
deep
learning
as
just
one
element
in
a
very
complicated
ensemble
of
techniques
ranging
from
the
statistical
technique
of
Bayesian
inference
to
deductive
reasoning
As
an
alternative
to
this
emphasis
on
the
limits
of
deep
learning
one
author
speculated
that
it
might
be
possible
to
train
a
machine
vision
stack
to
perform
the
sophisticated
task
of
discriminating
between
old
master
and
amateur
figure
drawings
and
hypothesized
that
such
a
sensitivity
might
represent
the
rudiments
of
a
non
trivial
machine
empathy
This
same
author
proposed
that
this
would
be
in
line
with
anthropology
which
identifies
a
concern
with
aesthetics
as
a
key
element
of
behavioral
modernity
In
further
reference
to
the
idea
that
artistic
sensitivity
might
inhere
within
relatively
low
levels
of
the
cognitive
hierarchy
a
published
series
of
graphic
representations
of
the
internal
states
of
deep
layers
neural
networks
attempting
to
discern
within
essentially
random
data
the
images
on
which
they
were
trained
demonstrate
a
visual
appeal
the
original
research
notice
received
well
over
comments
and
was
the
subject
of
what
was
for
a
time
the
most
frequently
accessed
article
on
The
Guardian
s
web
site
Errors
Some
deep
learning
architectures
display
problematic
behaviors
such
as
confidently
classifying
unrecognizable
images
as
belonging
to
a
familiar
category
of
ordinary
images
and
misclassifying
minuscule
perturbations
of
correctly
classified
images
Goertzel
hypothesized
that
these
behaviors
are
due
to
limitations
in
their
internal
representations
and
that
these
limitations
would
inhibit
integration
into
heterogeneous
multi
component
AGI
architectures
These
issues
may
possibly
be
addressed
by
deep
learning
architectures
that
internally
form
states
homologous
to
image
grammar
decompositions
of
observed
entities
and
events
Learning
a
grammar
visual
or
linguistic
from
training
data
would
be
equivalent
to
restricting
the
system
to
commonsense
reasoning
that
operates
on
concepts
in
terms
of
grammatical
production
rules
and
is
a
basic
goal
of
both
human
language
acquisition
and
AI
Cyberthreat
As
deep
learning
moves
from
the
lab
into
the
world
research
and
experience
shows
that
artificial
neural
networks
are
vulnerable
to
hacks
and
deception
By
identifying
patterns
that
these
systems
use
to
function
attackers
can
modify
inputs
to
ANNs
in
such
a
way
that
the
ANN
finds
a
match
that
human
observers
would
not
recognize
For
example
an
attacker
can
make
subtle
changes
to
an
image
such
that
the
ANN
finds
a
match
even
though
the
image
looks
to
a
human
nothing
like
the
search
target
Such
a
manipulation
is
termed
an
adversarial
attack
In
researchers
used
one
ANN
to
doctor
images
in
trial
and
error
fashion
identify
another
s
focal
points
and
thereby
generate
images
that
deceived
it
The
modified
images
looked
no
different
to
human
eyes
Another
group
showed
that
printouts
of
doctored
images
then
photographed
successfully
tricked
an
image
classification
system
One
defense
is
reverse
image
search
in
which
a
possible
fake
image
is
submitted
to
a
site
such
as
TinEye
that
can
then
find
other
instances
of
it
A
refinement
is
to
search
using
only
parts
of
the
image
to
identify
images
from
which
that
piece
may
have
been
taken
Another
group
showed
that
certain
psychedelic
spectacles
could
fool
a
facial
recognition
system
into
thinking
ordinary
people
were
celebrities
potentially
allowing
one
person
to
impersonate
another
In
researchers
added
stickers
to
stop
signs
and
caused
an
ANN
to
misclassify
them
ANNs
can
however
be
further
trained
to
detect
attempts
at
deception
potentially
leading
attackers
and
defenders
into
an
arms
race
similar
to
the
kind
that
already
defines
the
malware
defense
industry
ANNs
have
been
trained
to
defeat
ANN
based
anti
malware
software
by
repeatedly
attacking
a
defense
with
malware
that
was
continually
altered
by
a
genetic
algorithm
until
it
tricked
the
anti
malware
while
retaining
its
ability
to
damage
the
target
Another
group
demonstrated
that
certain
sounds
could
make
the
Google
Now
voice
command
system
open
a
particular
web
address
that
would
download
malware
In
